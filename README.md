Excel-based decision support tool for selecting pile foundation systems based on soil, project constraints, and risk factors.

## Overview
This project is a **technical decision-support Excel tool** developed for construction and geotechnical engineers.
It assists in selecting the most suitable **pile foundation system** based on:

- Project constraints
- Soil and groundwater conditions
- Constructability risks
- Environmental and execution considerations

> ⚠️ This is a **technical engineering tool**, not financial or AI software.

## Excel Structure
1. **Introduction & Instructions**
2. **Project & Soil Input** (dropdowns, Yes/No fields)
3. **Pile System Database** (fully editable)
4. **Scoring & Weighting Model**
5. **Automatic Advice & Conclusion**

## Typical Use Cases
- Early-stage foundation concept selection
- Comparison of driven vs bored vs screw piles
- Urban sites with vibration/noise constraints
- Restricted access or environmentally sensitive projects

---

## Disclaimer
This tool provides **engineering support only**.  
Final foundation selection must be verified using:
- Geotechnical investigation data
- Applicable design codes (EC7, AASHTO, etc.)
- Engineering judgment and construction experience
